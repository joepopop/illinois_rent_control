### Description
This project was undertaken on behalf of the Lift the Ban Coalition, a non-profit organization that aims to lift the ban on rent control in Illinois in order to increase the affordability of housing in the state. However, opponents of rent control argue that it disproportionately harms small, independent landlords. The objective of this project was to assess the number of such landlords who may be affected by rent control and to propose solutions that balance the need for affordable housing with the interests of small-scale property owners. The report presents data in a clear and concise manner to aid the organization in developing effective legislation.

### How it works
The report is a comprehensive resource that utilizes a variety of analytical techniques to provide deep insights into the proposed solution. It features text, informative tables, visually engaging data visualizations, and interactive tools that work together seamlessly to help unlock key insights and provide a clear understanding of the complex issues involved. The result is a highly refined and elegant resource that empowers policymakers and stakeholders to make informed decisions and develop effective strategies.
